Data for this application was obtained from the [i-CeM project](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/history/research/icem/) at the University of Essex via Gillian Raab. The data consists of household and demographic information from the 1901 Census of Scotland. See our paper for more details on the data methods and synthesis.

Note that there are slight discrepancies in these graphs versus the orginal graphs presented in the paper. The graphs reported in the paper came from an earlier version of the code before a random seed has been set. This has since been corrected.
